  I have received the <em><a href="https://www.eurographics.es/ceig23-premios/">Best Bachelor's Thesis Award</a></em> given by Eurographics Sección Española for my Bachelor's Thesis about reconstruction of time-resolved NLOS light transport! This has given me the oportunity to attend CEIG 2023 and present this work to a wider audience of researchers in computer graphics and vision.
