  Our paper <em>Looking Around Flatland: End-to-End 2D Real-Time NLOS Imaging</em> has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging. We couple two-dimensional transient light transport simulation and NLOS imaging, and provide a real-time end-to-end pipeline to analyze NLOS imaging performance with comprehensive control on a wide set of scene, rendering, and imaging parameters. <a href="https://graphics.unizar.es/projects/LookingAroundFlatland/" target="_blank">Read more <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></a>
